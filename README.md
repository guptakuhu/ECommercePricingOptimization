# ECommercePricingOptimization
This project focuses on optimizing E-Commerce pricing strategies using probabilistic programming. Two implementations are explored: one in Python with a standard probabilistic programming library and another in Pyro, a probabilistic programming language built on PyTorch.

## Project Structure

Contains the implementation of the E-Commerce pricing strategy using a standard probabilistic programming library in Python.
Houses the implementation of the same pricing strategy but using Pyro for probabilistic programming.

## Key Features

Leveraging probabilistic programming concepts to model uncertainty in pricing decisions.
A structured comparison between Python (with a standard library) and Pyro, evaluating aspects such as syntax, ease of use, expressiveness, and integration with deep learning.
Demonstrates the application of fundamental programming principles, including abstraction, modularity, and readability.
